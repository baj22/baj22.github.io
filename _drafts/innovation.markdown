I want to clear up some misconceptions about what innovation is and what it isn't.

# Unprecedented
All innovation is necessarily unprecedented.  If you are copying someone else, you are not innovating.  You may be current, you may be cutting edge, but you are not innovating.  Adapting an idea from a different field and cross pollinating can be an innovation as long as you aren't copying someone in your own.

# Unpredictable
You can't schedule a trip through unknown terrain.  If you are innovating and doing unprecedented things, the journey will be unpredictable.

Quick diversion:
This is a HUGE problem for most businesses, especially larger ones.  Businesses employ lots of managers to control situations and make things predictable.  Innovation requires vision and embracing a lack of control.  Innovation is done by leaders, not managers.  A vision that rests on the horizon allows you to adapt to obstacles as they come up.  As long as your view is far enough away, you can judge at each new obstacle whether you need to go over, around, or through.  You cannot plan your moves step by step and expect to stick to it.

# Failure is expected
Related to the unpredictability of unprecedented innovation is the fact you will fail along the way.  You can't walk through unknown places without stumbling and falling.  I like the quote "the master has failed more than the novice has tried."

Another diversion:
This is another major sticking point for big businesses.  In the book Misbehaving, Richard Thaler tells a story about a group of executives he was speaking to.  The CEO entered the room and listened from the back.  Thaler asked the 23 VPs present what they would do if an opportunity came up for the business with a 50% chance of making $1,000,000 and a 50% chance of losing $500,000.  Of the 23, only 3 said they would do it and the others all declined despite the positive expected value.  When asked why, they responded that if it succeeded they might get a small bonus but if it failed they might get fired.  He asked the CEO what he wanted them to do and he made the obvious answer that they should all take the chance.  This underscores that in large companies the ability to fail (and by extension, innovate) is limited not by money, but by permission and incentives.

As companies grow larger and as individuals have successful careers within those companies, there exists a strong temptation to preserve what you have and become more conservative (you are only conservative if you have something to conserve).  I believe innovation is better served with the military philosophy "fear not, we are already dead."

# Why innovate?
If businesses play too conservatively and just try to hold their existing business, they risk external disruption.  Somewhere out there is a startup with nothing to lose that will relentlessly change all the variables one by one until they find the magic formula, and when they do they will cash in.

# Innovate all the things?
NO!  Some things are dumb to innovate.  When Tesla created their cars, they didn't innovate seat placement by attaching them to walls or ceilings.  They didn't replace the doors with a hatch on top like a submarine.  They didn't remove windows or change the wheels to something less round.  Those would be bad changes.

# What can be innovated?
Innovations are not just technology.  You can change and adapt your business model to better suit your customer.

# Why is this hard for businesses?
Big businesses are designed to make money through efficiencies and predictability, innovation doesn't match either of those metrics.  It is hard to get permission from a big business to innovate because it is against the business's nature.

# How do you innovate?
Build, measure, learn.  It starts with a pure customer focus.  Build a persona around them and then spend some time in their shoes.  What are their pain points?  Interview them and listen to what they are saying between the lines.  You want to offer them painkillers, not vitamins.  When you believe you have identified a pain point, design a simple experiment to test your hypothesis.  Many people refer to this as "validation", but that assumes the positive.  Allow yourself to be wrong and just call it a test, don't pressure yourself to make your hypothesis right.  At this point you are not making a product, so this should be the absolute simplest test you can think of.  If you are testing price sensitivity, sell a few of your existing products to a select number of customers at a massive loss.  If you are testing recurring revenue vs upfront payment, lease your existing product to a few select customers.  If you are testing a revolutionary tech idea, try hacking off the shelf components (especially $10 Walmart cell phones) to see if the idea has value before you start a massive engineering effort.  And always circle back to talk to the customer.  You don't have to limit yourself to what they are asking for (if Ford asked his customers what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse), but you do have to alleviate pain for them
