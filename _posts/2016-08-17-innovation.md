title:  "Innovation"
---
I want to clear up some misconceptions about what innovation is and isn't.

# Unprecedented
All innovation is, by definition, unprecedented.  If you are copying someone else, you are not innovating.  You may be current, you may be cutting edge, but you are not innovating.  Adapting an idea from a different field can be innovative.  Cross pollination is good, just don't copy your competitors and call it innovation.

# Unpredictable
You can't schedule a trip through unknown terrain.  If you are innovating and doing unprecedented things, the journey will be unpredictable.

Quick diversion:
This is a HUGE problem for many businesses, especially larger ones.  Businesses use lots of managers to control situations and make things predictable.  Innovation requires vision and embracing a lack of control.  Innovation requires leaders, not managers.  A vision that rests on the horizon allows you to adapt to obstacles as they come up.  If your view is far enough away, you can judge at each new obstacle whether you need to go over, around, or through.  You cannot plan your moves step by step and expect to stick to that plan when innovating.

# Failure will happen
Because of the unpredictability of unprecedented innovation, you will fail along the way.  You can't walk through unknown places without stumbling and falling.  I like the quote "the master has failed more than the beginner has even tried."

Another diversion:
This is another major sticking point for big businesses.  In the book Misbehaving, Richard Thaler tells a story about a group of 23 corporate VPs he was speaking to.  The CEO listened from the back.  Thaler asked the VPs how they would respond to an opportunity within their area of the business.  The opportunity had a 50% chance of making $1,000,000 and a 50% chance of losing $500,000.  Of the 23, only 3 said they would take it and the others all declined, despite the positive expected value.  Thaler asked why.  They responded that if it succeeded they might get a small bonus but if it failed they might get fired.  He asked the CEO what he wanted them to do and he made the obvious answer that they should all take the chance.

Large companies are not limited by money but by permission and incentives.  They cannot innovate until they give permission to take risks and fail to key employees.

Success tempts companies and individuals to become conservative and preserve what they have.  You are only conservative if you have something to conserve.  Innovation is better served with the military philosophy "fear not, we are already dead."

# Why innovate?
Businesses risk disruption from outside if they play too conservatively and just try to hold to existing business.  Somewhere is a startup with nothing to lose that will relentlessly change variables one by one until they find the magic formula.  When they find it, they will cash in and eat the business's lunch.

# Innovate all the things?
NO!  Some things are dumb to innovate. Tesla didn't change seat placement by attaching them to walls or ceilings.  They didn't replace doors with a hatch on top like a submarine.  They didn't remove windows or change the wheels to something less round.  Those would be bad changes.

# What to innovate?
Innovations are not just technology.  You can change and adapt your business model to better suit your customer.  Perhaps a different sales channel would revolutionize your industry.  Maybe employee rewards are not incentivising.

# Why is innovation hard for businesses?
Many businesses grow and make money through efficiencies.  Innovation doesn't work with that metric.  It is against the business's nature to give permission to innovate.

# How do you innovate?
Build, measure, learn.  It starts with a pure customer focus.  Build a persona around them and then spend some time in their shoes.  What are their pain points?  Interview them and listen to what they are saying between the lines.  You want to offer them painkillers, not vitamins.  Design a simple experiment to test if you have identified a pain point.  Many people refer to this as "validation", but that assumes the positive.  Don't pressure yourself to make your hypothesis right and just call it a test.  At this point you are not making a product, so this should be the absolute simplest test you can think of.  If you are testing price sensitivity, sell a few of your existing products to a select number of customers at a massive loss.  If you are testing recurring revenue vs upfront payment, lease your existing product to a few select customers.  If you are testing a revolutionary tech idea, try hacking off the shelf components to see if the idea has value before you start a massive engineering effort.  (a $10 cell phone from Walmart is great for this!)  And always circle back to talk to the customer.  You don't have to limit yourself to what they are asking for, but you do have to remove pain for them.
